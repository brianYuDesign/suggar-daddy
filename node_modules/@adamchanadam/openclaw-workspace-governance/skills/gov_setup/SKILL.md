# /gov_setup

## Purpose
Deploy this plugin's governance prompt assets into the current workspace at `prompts/governance/`.
`check` mode is a read-only diagnostic for first-time setup and upgrade readiness.

## Inputs
- Optional mode: `install` (default), `upgrade`, or `check`.

## Required behavior
1. Resolve plugin root from this skill directory:
   - `plugin_root = {baseDir}/../..`
2. Resolve workspace root as the current OpenClaw workspace directory.
   - Do not assume `~/.openclaw/workspace` as a fixed path.
3. For `install` and `upgrade` only, ensure target folders exist:
   - `prompts/governance/`
   - `prompts/governance/manual_prompt/`
   For `check`, do not create folders (read-only).
4. If mode is `upgrade` and target files already exist:
   - Create backup under `archive/_gov_setup_backup_<ts>/prompts/governance/...`
5. Copy the following source files from `plugin_root` into workspace `prompts/governance/`:
   - `OpenClaw_INIT_BOOTSTRAP_WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE.md`
   - `WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE_MIGRATION.md`
   - `APPLY_UPGRADE_FROM_BOOT.md`
   - `WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE_README.md`
   - `manual_prompt/MIGRATION_prompt_for_RUNNING_OpenClaw.md`
   - `manual_prompt/POST_MIGRATION_AUDIT_prompt_for_RUNNING_OpenClaw.md`
6. If mode is `check`:
   - Do not copy files.
   - Only report whether each target file exists and whether source files are discoverable.
   - Return one status:
     - `NOT_INSTALLED`: target folder missing or target files absent (common right after plugin install).
     - `PARTIAL`: target exists but one or more required files are missing/out-of-sync.
     - `READY`: all required files are present.
   - Provide next action:
     - `NOT_INSTALLED` -> run `/gov_setup install`
     - `PARTIAL` -> run `/gov_setup upgrade`
     - `READY` -> continue with `/gov_migrate` and `/gov_audit` as needed
7. After install or upgrade:
   - Print next steps:
     - First adoption: run `OpenClaw_INIT_BOOTSTRAP_WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE.md`
     - Existing workspace: run `/gov_migrate`, then `/gov_audit`
8. If operator asks OpenClaw system questions (commands/config/paths) during setup:
   - Verify against local skill docs and official docs `https://docs.openclaw.ai` before answering.
   - For latest/version-sensitive claims, also verify official releases `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases`.
   - If verification cannot be completed, report uncertainty and required next check; do not infer.
9. If operator asks date/time-sensitive setup questions:
   - Verify runtime current time context (session status) before answering.

## Output requirements
- Report source root, target root, files copied (or checked), and backup path if created.
- If any required source file is missing, stop and report missing paths.
- In `check` mode, include:
  - `status` (`NOT_INSTALLED` / `PARTIAL` / `READY`)
  - `next_action`
  - file lists in code blocks (one path per line) to avoid UI table-wrap ambiguity.
  - if `status=NOT_INSTALLED`, append a `Quick Start` command block:
    - `/gov_setup install`
    - fallback: `/skill gov_setup install`
