# /gov_migrate

## Purpose
Execute the migration workflow defined by:
- `prompts/governance/WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE_MIGRATION.md`

## Hard contract
1. If `_control/GOVERNANCE_BOOTSTRAP.md` is missing, stop and instruct the operator to run bootstrap first.
2. Follow the migration prompt exactly (no skipped gates).
3. Preserve non-target user files.
4. After migration, instruct operator to run `/gov_audit`.
5. Treat workspace root as runtime-resolved `<workspace-root>`; do not hardcode `~/.openclaw/workspace`.
6. For OpenClaw system claims (commands/config/plugins/skills/hooks), verify using:
   - relevant local skill docs under `skills/`
   - official docs at `https://docs.openclaw.ai`
   - official releases at `https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases` for latest/version-sensitive claims
   - if verification cannot be completed, report uncertainty and required next check; do not infer
7. For date/time-sensitive claims, verify runtime current time context first (session status).

## Fallback
- If slash command is unavailable or name-collided, use:
  - `/skill gov_migrate`
